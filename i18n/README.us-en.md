# Easy Registry Mirror

English | [简体中文](https://github.com/shencangsheng/easy-registry-mirror)

**Easy Registry Mirror** aims to help users quickly set up a private Docker registry without needing to modify existing Dockerfile or docker-compose.yaml files, resulting in almost no migration costs. Additionally, this project supports private repositories for Maven, npm, and PyPI, with plans to support more types of repositories in the future.

## Trying

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shencangsheng/easy-registry-mirror.git
cd easy-registry-mirror
chmod +x ctl
./ctl help
./ctl docker help
./ctl docker install
./ctl npm help
./ctl maven help
./ctl pypi help
./ctl status
```

## Features

1. Proxy Docker registry
2. Auto sync Docker images
3. npm registry
4. Maven registry
5. PyPI registry

## Upcoming Features

1. APT
2. Yum(RPM)
3. Conda
4. Go registry

## Principle

The principle is that all Docker requests first go through a proxy layer. The proxy determines whether the request is for fetching an image. If so, the proxy uploads the image to the Docker registry before forwarding the request to the Docker registry and responding. This strategy differs from the common approach of periodically synchronizing Docker Hub images by only fetching the required images, thus avoiding unnecessary traffic and storage waste. However, it still provides the functionality to automatically sync images weekly based on a list. Execute `./ctl docker sync help` to learn how to use this feature.

graph TD;
    A[Docker request] --> B[Docker registry proxy];
    B --> C{Get Docker image API?};
    C -- Yes --> D[Docker pull image];
    C -- No --> E[Docker registry server];
    D --> F[Upload Docker registry];
    F --> E
    E -- Response --> B
    B -- Response --> A
```
